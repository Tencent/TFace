## Introduction

TFace: A trusty face analysis research platform developed by Tencent Youtu Lab. It provides a high-performance distributed training framework and releases our efficient methods implementations.
Some of the algorithms are self-developed, and we believe the released codes benefits researchers to follow.

This project consists of several modules: **Face Recognition**, **Face Security** and **Face Quality**.
